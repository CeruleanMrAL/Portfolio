		I am currently an honors senior in high school studying Programming/Web Design who also aspires to become
		<br>
		a video game developer, which is a goal that I've had since I was really young &#40;probaby around the age of 3&#41;.
		<br>
		 As such, I have a lot of experience with computers and know a lot about them. In my spare time, I like to play
		<br>
		video games and make music. I don't have a job at the moment and have never had one before, but I'm currently
		<br>
		working to start selling my music as a job pretty soon.
		<br>
		<br>
		Here is a list of skills I have that I can use to make a living:
